### Option 1: Click the Key Name or Row

```
1. Click directly on "abby-onboarding..." (the key name)
   OR
   Click anywhere on that row

2. A detail panel or modal should open

3. Look for:
   - "View Key" button
   - "Show Key" button
   - Eye icon 👁️
   - "Copy Key" button

4. Click it to reveal or copy the full key
```

---

### Option 2: Use the Three Dots Menu (...)

```
1. On the right side of the "abby-onboarding" row
2. You'll see three dots "..." (ellipsis menu)
3. Click it
4. Look for options like:
   - "View Key"
   - "Show Key"
   - "Copy Key"
   - "Reveal"

5. Select that option
```

---

### Option 3: Hover Over the Partial Key

```

2. A tooltip might appear showing more characters
3. Or a copy icon might appear
4. Click to copy or reveal
```

---

## 🎯 What You're Looking For

The full key will look like:

```
sk-ant-api03-qNg[lots more characters]ka4A
```

**Complete format:**

## ⚠️ If You Can't Reveal It

**If the key is not revealable** (security policy after creation):

You have two options:

### Option A: Create a New Key (Recommended)
```
1. Click "+ Create Key" button (top right)
2. Name it: "Salesforce Job Search AI"
3. Select workspace: Default
4. Click "Create Key"
5. ⚠️ IMMEDIATELY COPY THE KEY - it only shows once!
6. Save it in notepad temporarily
7. Click "Done" or "I saved it"
```

**Advantage:** You'll definitely have the full key
**Note:** You can delete the new key later if you find the original

---

### Option B: Use the Second Key Instead

You also have "Voice Assistant..." key that was used on Oct 29, 2025.

If you can reveal that one, you could use it (though the first unused one is preferable).
