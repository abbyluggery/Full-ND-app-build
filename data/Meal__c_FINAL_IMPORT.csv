1 onion, chopped	
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped	
5 carrots, sliced	
3 potatoes, diced	
3 (10.5 ounce) cans organic beef broth	
2 stalks celery, chopped	
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes	
¼ cup Marsala wine	
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix	
2 cloves garlic, minced	
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce	
salt and ground black pepper to taste	
2 tablespoons cornstarch (Optional)	
2 tablespoons water (Optional)	
	
Directions	
1. Combine flour, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, seasoned salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Add beef, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Shake bag until beef thoroughly coated with seasoned flour.	
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Remove beef from seasoned flour and shake off excess. Add beef, onion, and mushrooms to the skillet; cook and stir until beef is evenly browned and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.	
3. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker. Stir in carrots, potatoes, beef broth, celery, tomatoes, Marsala wine, onion soup mix, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and remaining 1 teaspoon smoked paprika. Cover slow cooker.	
4. Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours or on Low for 10 to 12 hours. Season with salt and black pepper.

To make ahead and cook the stew later, place beef mixture into a resealable plastic freezer bag after Step 2 and freeze. Place potatoes, carrots, and celery into a separate bag and freeze. Combine Marsala wine, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce in a third bag and freeze. The day before you want to cook the stew, allow all three bags to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then transfer the thawed ingredients to the slow cooker. Then stir beef broth, tomatoes, onion soup mix, and remaining 1 teaspoon smoked paprika into slow cooker. Slow cook as per the recipe instructions.

How to Store Chicken and Rice Casserole
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. It's important to thoroughly reheat any dish with rice, as leftover rice can grow a bacteria that causes foodborne illness (even when it's stored in the fridge).
Add a few drops of water to keep the rice moist, then reheat it in the oven or microwave to a piping hot temperature (or at least 165 degrees F). Use a food thermometer to ensure it has reached the proper temperature.

How to Freeze Chicken and Rice Casserole
This cozy casserole freezes well. If you plan to freeze it, cook the recipe in an aluminum pan. Let the casserole cool completely, then cover it with a layer of storage wrap and a layer of aluminum foil. Store in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight, then reheat in the oven or microwave."

Cook's Notes:
I prepare my dry rub seasoned pork shoulder in a slow cooker, cool it, and then pull it by hand, gently creating chunks of pork. Then, I use a cleaver to chop it, and finally, I finish it in a grill pan over high heat, adding more dry rub seasoning.
I order the dry rub from Rendezvous in Memphis.
Finishing it on the grill pan makes the meat crispy, mimicking the all important ""bark"" formed on the outside of true barbeque. It also renders out some fat, so the pork isn't as rich.
The potato nuggets should be extra crispy so they don't sog out when buried in the toppings."

Did you know you can make restaurant worthy baby back ribs in the comfort of your own kitchen? Well, you can! You just need a good recipe — and that's where we come in. This top rated recipe produces tender, juicy ribs that you'll want to make again and again.	
	
What Are Baby Back Ribs?	
Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful. Baby back ribs can be smoked, grilled, or baked. They're usually seasoned and often served with a sweet and savory barbecue sauce.	
	
How to Cook Baby Back Ribs in the Oven	
Make perfect baby back ribs in the oven by following a few simple steps. You'll find Chef John's full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:	
Prepare Dry Rub	
Mix ancho chile powder, white and brown sugars, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl.	
Season and Bake	
Place the rack on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Prick the rack several times with a knife. Season liberally on both sides with dry rub, then seal tightly in foil. Bake until tender and cooked through.	
Glaze, Bake, and Repeat	
Remove the rack from the oven, let cool slightly, and open the foil seal. Completely coat the rack in barbecue sauce, brushing it on all sides. Return it to the oven (with the foil open) and bake for about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven again and brush again with barbecue sauce (on the meat side only). Repeat this process about four times, then cut and serve.	
	
How Long to Cook Baby Back Ribs	
This recipe generally takes about 2 hours and 50 minutes to cook. However, racks vary in size — bigger racks might take longer to cook, while smaller ones might be ready more quickly.	
Turn to your digital food thermometer for the most precise results: Ribs are technically safe to eat when they reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, but they will be most tender and juicy between 190 and 200 degrees F.	
	
How to Store Baby Back Ribs	
Store your cooked baby back rib leftovers in an airtight container or wrap them tightly in storage wrap or aluminum foil. Properly stored baby back ribs will last for up to four days in the refrigerator. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

These banana chocolate chip muffins are soft, moist, and easy to make whenever you have some ripe bananas. They're my kids' favorite homemade treat — they love to see who gets the most chocolate chips in a muffin!
Prep Time: 10 mins; Cook Time: 25 mins; Total Time: 35 mins; Servings: 12; Yield: 12 muffins

These banana chocolate chip muffins are made with easy baking ingredients, plain yogurt, naturally sweet mashed bananas, and plenty of chocolate chips so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture and flavor. Very ripe bananas will work best for this recipe.

This recipe is very easy to make: Just combine your dry ingredients and your wet ingredients separately, then stir together until combined. Then, you’ll fold in the bananas and chocolate chips, portion into muffin tins, and let your oven do the rest of the work.

Banana Chocolate chip muffins are a nice, warm treat almost anytime. If you like to change up your morning meal now and then or take a snack with you for the day, this is a great way to do that. Store these muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to five days or in the freezer for up to three months. To avoid freezer burn, wrap each muffin in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag or container. Reheat in the microwave or thaw on the counter at room temperature when you want one.
