These banana chocolate chip muffins are soft, moist, and easy to make whenever you have some ripe bananas. They're my kids' favorite homemade treat â€” they love to see who gets the most chocolate chips in a muffin!
Prep Time: 10 mins; Cook Time: 25 mins; Total Time: 35 mins; Servings: 12; Yield: 12 muffins

These banana chocolate chip muffins are made with easy baking ingredients, plain yogurt, naturally sweet mashed bananas, and plenty of chocolate chips so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture and flavor. Very ripe bananas will work best for this recipe.

This recipe is very easy to make: Just combine your dry ingredients and your wet ingredients separately, then stir together until combined. Then, youâ€™ll fold in the bananas and chocolate chips, portion into muffin tins, and let your oven do the rest of the work.

Banana Chocolate chip muffins are a nice, warm treat almost anytime. If you like to change up your morning meal now and then or take a snack with you for the day, this is a great way to do that. Store these muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to five days or in the freezer for up to three months. To avoid freezer burn, wrap each muffin in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag or container. Reheat in the microwave or thaw on the counter at room temperature when you want one.

How to Store Chicken and Rice Casserole
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. It's important to thoroughly reheat any dish with rice, as leftover rice can grow a bacteria that causesÂ foodborne illnessÂ (even when it's stored in the fridge).
Add a few drops of water to keep the rice moist, then reheat it in the oven or microwave to a piping hot temperature (or at least 165 degrees F). Use a food thermometer to ensure it has reached the proper temperature.

How to Freeze Chicken and Rice Casserole
This cozy casserole freezes well. If you plan to freeze it, cook the recipe in an aluminum pan. Let the casserole cool completely, then cover it with a layer of storage wrap and a layer of aluminum foil. Store in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight, then reheat in the oven or microwave."

Cook's Notes:
I prepare my dry rub seasoned pork shoulder in a slow cooker, cool it, and then pull it by hand, gently creating chunks of pork. Then, I use a cleaver to chop it, and finally, I finish it in a grill pan over high heat, adding more dry rub seasoning.
I order the dry rub from Rendezvous in Memphis.
Finishing it on the grill pan makes the meat crispy, mimicking the all important ""bark"" formed on the outside of true barbeque. It also renders out some fat, so the pork isn't as rich.
The potato nuggets should be extra crispy so they don't sog out when buried in the toppings."

Did you know you can make restaurant worthy baby back ribs in the comfort of your own kitchen? Well, you can! You just need a good recipe â€” and that's where we come in. This top rated recipe produces tender, juicy ribs that you'll want to make again and again.	
	
What Are Baby Back Ribs?	
Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful. Baby back ribs can be smoked, grilled, or baked. They're usually seasoned and often served with a sweet and savory barbecue sauce.	
	
How to Cook Baby Back Ribs in the Oven	
Make perfect baby back ribs in the oven by following a few simple steps. You'll findÂ Chef John's full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:	
Prepare Dry Rub	
Mix ancho chile powder, white and brown sugars, salt, black pepper, cumin, dry mustard, cayenne, and chipotle pepper in a small bowl.	
Season and Bake	
Place the rack on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Prick the rack several times with a knife. Season liberally on both sides with dry rub, then seal tightly in foil. Bake until tender and cooked through.	
Glaze, Bake, and Repeat	
Remove the rack from the oven, let cool slightly, and open the foil seal. Completely coat the rack in barbecue sauce, brushing it on all sides. Return it to the oven (with the foil open) and bake for about 10 more minutes. Remove from the oven again and brush again with barbecue sauce (on the meat side only). Repeat this process about four times, then cut and serve.	
	
How Long to Cook Baby Back Ribs	
This recipe generally takes about 2 hours and 50 minutes to cook. However, racks vary in size â€” bigger racks might take longer to cook, while smaller ones might be ready more quickly.	
Turn to your digital food thermometer for the most precise results: Ribs are technically safe to eat when they reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F, but they will be most tender and juicy between 190 and 200 degrees F.	
	
How to Store Baby Back Ribs	
Store your cooked baby back rib leftovers in an airtight container or wrap them tightly in storage wrap or aluminum foil. Properly stored baby back ribs will last for up to four days in the refrigerator. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

Ingredients
8Â tablespoonsÂ butter
4Â largeÂ red onions, thinly sliced
4Â largeÂ sweet onions, thinly sliced
2Â teaspoonsÂ salt
2Â (48 fluid ounce) canÂ chicken broth
2Â (14 ounce) canÂ beef broth
1Â cupÂ red wine
2Â tablespoonsÂ Worcestershire sauce
4Â sprigsÂ fresh parsley
2Â sprigÂ fresh thyme leaves
2Â bay leaf
2Â tablespoonsÂ balsamic vinegar
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
8Â thick slicesÂ French bread
16Â slicesÂ GruyÃ¨re cheese, at room temperature
1Â cupÂ shredded Asiago cheese, at room temperature
8Â pinchesÂ paprika

Directions
1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. Stir in red onions, sweet onions, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are caramelized and almost syrupy, about 35 minutes.
2. Stir in chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce. Bundle parsley, thyme, and bay leaf with kitchen twine; add to the pot. Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard herb bundle. Reduce heat to low; stir in vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cover soup and keep warm over low heat while you prepare the toast.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet and broil, turning once, until well toasted on both sides, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; do not turn off the broiler.
4. Arrange 4 large oven safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill each bowl 2/3 full with hot soup. Top each bowl with 1 slice of toasted bread, 2 slices GruyÃ¨re cheese, and 1/4 of the Asiago cheese. Sprinkle a little bit of paprika over the top of each one.
5. Cook under the hot broiler until bubbly and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cheese will cascade over the sides of the crock and form a beautifully melted crusty seal as it melts.
6. Serve hot and enjoy!"

1. Gather all ingredients.
2. Scoop out as many potato balls as you can per potato using the smaller end of a Parisian scooper, 8 or 9 balls per large potato. You can't get too many out of each potato. If you want perfectly shaped balls, don't scoop too close together.
3. Drop potato balls into a large bowl of cold fresh water so they don't discolor. Use potato carcasses for another use, e.g. potato pancakes.
4. Add potato balls, water, and kosher salt to a large pot. Stir and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Once water is boiling, boil for just 2 minutes. Potatoes should still be firm, but not raw.
5. Turn off heat and remove potato balls with a strainer. Allow to drain in one layer on a plate lined with paper towels. Cool until they are room temperature.
6. Heat clarified butter in a skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Carefully add completely dry and cooled potatoes to butter. Brown potatoes until outsides are golden and crispy, and the insides are tender and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes. Move and stir potatoes often so they brown evenly .
7. Remove from heat and serve immediately.","If you are cooking for somebody special on date night, these gorgeous crispy potato balls would be an excellent choice.
